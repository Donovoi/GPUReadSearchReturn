# GPUReadSearchReturn
learning about searching data using the gpu


I know nothing about GPU programming but I'll try my best (part time) to learn some of it here and hopefully apply it to projects in the future.

My ultimate goal is to be able to use Microsoft's Direct Storage API to find patterns in large datasets using a GPU where a CPU may not be the best choice.

Goals of this project:
* Understand how to write python programs that use the GPU to find search patterns
* Learn Computer Science
* Learn CPP at the point where I can understand SIMD,Intrinsics,pointers, pointers to pointers, etc..
* Start playing around with the Direct Storage API
* GPU programming OPENCL, CUDA, GPUGPU
* Hopefully have a POC
* Keep learning, Keep improving
